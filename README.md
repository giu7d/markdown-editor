# Markdown to JSX

This is a challenge to create a parser based on regular expressions to convert markdown markup language to React.js JSX objects.

I've only implement some basic language features, like:

- Headers (H1, H2, H3...)
- Bold
- Italic
- Monospace

But, lay down the foundations for more utilities, like images, links, etc.

This repository is just a challanges to improve my skills as a dev and should not be used for production.
